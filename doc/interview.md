# Interview Tricks

* Do Homework(知己知彼，百战百胜)
1. What is the company business?
2. What is the company software developing style? 
（how many developerd? 
how do they separate the work? 
how to they assign the work? 
how do they check the work?)
3. What technology they are using?
4. project life-cycle?
    如果在网上找不到，怎么办？
    在interview中仔细观察，体验，询问，甚至请求做记录，以体现你工作的认真态度
5. How much you know about the technology?
6. What you can contribute to their work?
7. Who will interview? (job background, position, what they know about the tech)
8. interview time is some how fixed, if you don't speak, you give them more time to ask?(问一答十)
   不说自己不懂的东西，尽量说他们感兴趣又不太真懂的话题。对于别人了解自己不了解的话题，问一答一，言多必失。
9. 如果别人问你还有什么问题，一定要说有，比如公司的待遇，公司的发展未来，公司的晋升机制，公司如何对待新人的培养等等。。。
