# Practice and Homework

1. print even number within 1 to 10 by using for loop and if condition;
2. print odd number within 1 to 20 by using for loop and if condition;

3. Reciprocals 
>Use a for loop to print the decimal representations of 1/2, 1/3, ..., 1/10, one on each line.

4. Triangule numbers
>Use a for loop to compute the 10th triangular number. The nth triangular number is defined as 1+2+3+...+n. (You can also compute the nth triangular number as n*(n+1)/2. Use this formula to double-check that your loop is correct.)
Hint: This outline is an almost-complete solution. You only have to replace each ellipsis by an expression.
```py
n = 10
triangular = 0
for i in ...:
    triangular = ...
print "Triangular number", n, "via loop:", triangular
print "Triangular number", n, "via formula:", n*(n+1)/2
```
>Your solution must not mention the number 10, except in the n = 10 line. Your solution can use n, but not 10. In other words, your code (after the n = 10 line) should work for any value of n.

5. Factorial
>Use a for loop to compute 10!, the factorial of 10. Recall that the factorial of n is 1*2*3*...*n.

>The first line of your solution will be n = 10. After that, your solution should not use 10 again, though your solution will use n. In other words, your code (after the n = 10 line) should work for any value of n.

6. Multiple factorials
>Write code to print the first 10 factorials, in reverse order. In other words, write code that prints 10!, then prints 9!, then prints 8!, ..., then prints 1!. Its literal output will be:
```
3628800
362880
40320
5040
720
120
24
6
2
1
```
>The first line of your solution should assign a variable numlines to 10, and then the rest of your solution must not use 10 anywhere.

7. Sums of recprocals of factorials
Compute the following value:
```
  1 + 1/1! + 1/2! + 1/3! + 1/4! + ... + 1/10!
```
The value should be close to e (â‰ˆ 2.71828), the base of the natural logarithms.

8. use for loop to print the following patten
```
1
2 2
3 3 3
4 4 4 4
```

9. use for loop to print the following patten
```
   1
  2 2
 3 3 3
4 4 4 4
```
10. use for loop to print the following patten
```
   1
  2 2
 3 3 3
4 4 4 4
 3 3 3
  2 2
   1
```
