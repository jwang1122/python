Guido van Rossum, the creator of the Python programming language, 
today announced that he has unretired and joined Microsoft’s 
Developer Division.

Van Rossum, who was last employed by Dropbox,  
retired last October after six and a half years at the company. 
Clearly, that retirement wasn’t meant to last. At Microsoft, 
van Rossum says, he'll work to "make using Python better for sure 
(and not just on Windows)."
